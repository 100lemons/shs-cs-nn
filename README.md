# This is a class assignment on neural network

## Requirements
Hey class! Here's the template code you can use to write basic neural networks based on the lesson I gave today (you can rename the classes to remove 'Test_' if you want). Reference the slides for specific info. about implementation of the functions for the 3 different classes and the 3Blue1Brown video on neural networks I played so you understand how it works. The project submission will be a bundled .zip file of all of these classes. Next week I may have a few people- who want to volunteer- come up and present their projects. Note that the submission date is Monday night.

Update: to give everyone more time to work on the project in class and get familiar with things, I have extended the deadline until Tuesday night.

## Solution
A user inputs a String, then the neural network predicts character by character to match each user input char.

## How to Use
Make sure you have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed.
Then run:
```bash
mvn package
java -jar target/neural-network-0.0.1.jar
```
